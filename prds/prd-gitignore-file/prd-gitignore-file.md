# PRD: Comprehensive .gitignore File

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for the "LiveKit AI Agent" project written in Python. The goal is to ensure that generated files, sensitive credentials, and environment-specific configurations are never committed to the version control repository. This helps maintain a clean, secure, and portable codebase.

## 2. Goals

-   To create a robust `.gitignore` file that prevents common generated files from being tracked by Git.
-   To explicitly ignore all sensitive information, such as API keys and local environment configurations.
-   To ensure the repository remains clean and focused solely on source code and essential project files.
-   To establish a clear process for implementation that includes following the project's branching and merging strategy.

## 3. User Stories

-   **As a developer,** I want to be confident that my local environment files (like `.env` or IDE settings) are not accidentally committed, so I can avoid polluting the repository and exposing my secrets.
-   **As a developer,** I want `git status` to only show meaningful changes to source code, so I can easily review and stage my work without noise from generated files.
-   **As a new contributor,** I want to clone the repository and have it work without needing to clean up someone else's environment-specific files, so I can get started on development quickly.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. General Exclusions
The `.gitignore` file must ignore files and directories commonly generated by operating systems.
-   **macOS:** `.DS_Store`, `.AppleDouble`, `.LSOverride`
-   **Windows:** `Thumbs.db`, `ehthumbs.db`, `Desktop.ini`

### 4.2. Python Project Exclusions
The file must ignore standard Python artifacts.
-   Virtual environments: `/.venv`, `/venv/`, `/env/`, `/*.env`
-   Bytecode and compiled files: `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `*$py.class`
-   Distribution and build artifacts: `/build/`, `/dist/`, `/*.egg-info/`
-   Test and coverage reports: `.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`, `.tox/`
-   Notebook checkpoints: `.ipynb_checkpoints`

### 4.3. IDE and Editor Exclusions
The file must ignore configuration directories from common IDEs.
-   **VSCode:** `.vscode/` (unless a project-specific settings file needs to be shared, which is not the case here)
-   **JetBrains (PyCharm, etc.):** `.idea/`
-   **Sublime Text:** `*.sublime-project`, `*.sublime-workspace`

### 4.4. Sensitive File Exclusions
The file must explicitly ignore all files containing secrets or local configurations.
-   Environment files: `.env`
-   Cursor MCP configuration: `*mcp.json`
-   Any other files containing credentials or keys.

### 4.5. File Exceptions
The `.gitignore` must be configured to **never** ignore files that are templates for sensitive files.
-   Allow any file ending in `.example`: `!*.example`

### 4.6. LiveKit Specifics
Based on research of LiveKit's Python SDKs, there are no unique LiveKit-specific generated files. However, the development setup often involves `protobuf` and `grpc`, so the `.gitignore` should account for any Python files generated by those tools if they appear during development.

### 4.7. Branching and Merging Strategy
The implementation of this feature must adhere strictly to the project's defined branching and merging strategy. The developer must:
1.  Ensure they have the latest code from the `main` branch.
2.  Create a new feature branch (e.g., `feature/add-gitignore`).
3.  Perform all work on this new branch.
4.  Commit the `.gitignore` file to the branch.
5.  Push the branch to the remote repository.
6.  Create a Pull Request (PR) from the feature branch to `main`.
7.  Assign the PR to the designated reviewer (`raseniero`).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

-   This task does not include creating or modifying any files other than `.gitignore`.
-   This task does not include adding the `*.example` files themselves, only ensuring they are not ignored.

## 6. Success Metrics (Acceptance Criteria)

-   A `.gitignore` file exists in the root of the project.
-   After creating a virtual environment (e.g., `python -m venv .venv`), running `git status` does not show the `.venv` directory.
-   After running tests (generating `.pytest_cache` and `__pycache__`), `git status` shows no new untracked files related to these artifacts.
-   After creating a `.env` file and a `test.mcp.json` file, `git status` does not show these files.
-   After creating an `.env.example` file, `git status` **does** show this file as untracked, confirming it is not ignored.
-   The implementation is delivered via a Pull Request from a feature branch as described in section 4.7.
